        apply to purchases from Third Party Sellers, and others only apply to

        5 Conclusion of sales and availability of stock
      </h4>
      <p className="mx-8">
        5.1 Registered users may place orders for Goods, which Takealot or the
        Third Party Seller may accept or reject. Whether or not Takealot or the
        Third Party Seller accepts an order depends on the availability of
        Goods, correctness of the information relating to the Goods (including
        without limitation the price) and receipt of payment or payment
        authorisation by Takealot for the Goods. <br /> <br />
        5.2 NOTE: Takealot or the Third Party Seller will indicate the
        acceptance of your order by delivering the Goods to you or allowing you
        to collect them, and only at that point will an agreement of sale
        between you and Takealot or the Third Party Seller come into effect (the
        “Sale”). This is regardless of any communication from Takealot stating
        that your order or payment has been confirmed. Takealot will indicate
        the rejection of your order (by Takealot itself or the Third Party
        Seller) by cancelling it and, as soon as possible thereafter, refunding
        you for any amount already paid. <br /> <br />
        5.3 Prior to delivery or your collection of the Goods, you may cancel an
        order at any time provided you do so before receiving a dispatch or
        delivery notice. After delivery or your collection of the Goods, you may
        return the Goods only in accordance with the Returns Policy. <br />{" "}
        <br />
        5.4 Any order of a television will be subject to the condition that we
        obtain from you your valid TV licence number and your account holder ID.
        If we do not receive your TV licence number and your account holder ID,
        or your TV licence number cannot be validated, you will not be able to
        check out with the television in your shopping basket. <br /> <b></b>
        5.5 Placing Goods in a wishlist or shopping basket without completing
        the purchase cycle does not constitute an order for such Goods, and as
        such, Goods may be removed from the shopping basket if stock is no
        longer available or the price thereof might change without notice to
        you. You cannot hold Takealot or the Third Party Seller liable if such
        Goods are not available or are not available at the particular price
        when you complete or attempt to complete the purchase cycle at a later
        stage. <br /> <br />
        5.6 You acknowledge that stock of all Goods on offer is limited and that
        pricing may change at any time without notice to you. In the case of
        Goods for sale by Takealot, Takealot will take all reasonable efforts to
        monitor stock levels and ensure that when stock is no longer available,
        that offers thereof are discontinued on the Website. However, we cannot
        guarantee the availability of stock. When Goods are no longer available
        after you have placed an order, Takealot will notify you and you will be
        entitled to a refund of any amount already paid by you for such Goods.{" "}
        <br /> <br />
        5.7 In the case of Goods for sale by a Third Party Seller, Takealot
        relies on inventory information supplied by the relevant Third Party
        Seller and Takealot accordingly bears no liability for any inaccuracies
        in the information supplied to it. Consequently, should you order any
        Goods from a Third Party Seller which are in fact sold-out, any
        resulting dispute should be resolved between you and the relevant Third
        Party Seller, your respective rights and obligations being as set out in
        these Terms and Conditions. <br /> <br />
        5.8 Certain Goods may not be purchased for re-sale. Should we suspect
        that any such Goods are being purchased for sale, we are entitled to
        cancel your order immediately on notice to you. Please see details
        relating to Pre-orders in our Help Centre: Pre-Order, which are
        incorporated by reference.
