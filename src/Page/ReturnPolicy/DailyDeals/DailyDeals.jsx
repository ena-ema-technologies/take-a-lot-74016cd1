      <h2 className="text-lg font-bold">Daily Deals Terms and Conditions</h2>
      <p className="px-6">
        1. These Daily Deals Terms and Conditions are subject to, and should be
        read with, our general Terms and Conditions. <br />
        <br />
        2. At our discretion, Daily Deals (“Deals”) are available daily from 7am
        – 23:59pm on week days and from 9am – 23:59pm on weekends. In addition,
        please note that Daily Deals have a stock limit and may expire earlier
        if stock runs out. <br /> <br />
        3. Deal quantities are limited and as such, after a Deal is sold out,
        those particular Goods may be available on the Website at their normal
        selling prices (but no longer as a Deal). We do not guarantee a specific
        saving. The extent of the Deal is at the sole discretion of Takealot.
        Four of each Daily Deal may be purchased per customer. <br /> <br />
        4. Adding a Deal to your cart, or completing your order for a Deal
        without paying for it, does not reserve the item for you. Takealot must
        receive payment from you within 24 hours of you placing your order for a
        Deal, otherwise we will cancel your order. <br /> <br />
        5. Takealot will reserve stock for customers in the order in which it
        receives payment. Therefore if you pay via EFT, you might not get your
        item because Takealot may only receive payment from you a few days
        later, and in the meantime the Deal might sell out to customers paying
        immediately. <br /> <br />
        6. The List Price shown in respect of Deals and other discounted Goods
        is the recommended retail price suggested to us by the supplier of the
        relevant product. Where the supplier has not provided a recommended
        retail price, an estimate may be provided. Where a product is offered
        for sale by a Third Party Seller, the List Price may be provided by the
        Third Party Seller. <br /> <br />
        7. By purchasing any Deal, you are also automatically opting in for our
        Daily Deals daily newsletter as well as our general newsletter (you may
        opt-out of these newsletters at any time). Opting out of <br /> <br />
        8. these newsletters after purchase will not affect the value of the
        Goods purchased. <br /> <br />
        9. Takealot reserves the right to amend these Terms and Conditions at
        any time without notice to you.

      <h2 className="text-lg font-bold">App Only Deals Terms and Conditions</h2>
      <p className="px-6">
        We also have Deals (called “App Only Deals”) which will only be
        available for purchase using the Takealot software application (“App”),
        although they may also be displayed on the Takealot website and
        mobi-site. The App can be downloaded on IOS and Android devices. In
        addition to the above Daily Deal Terms and Conditions, the following
        terms apply to App Only Deals: <br /> <br />
        1. App Only Deals are only available for purchase using the App and
        their prices may differ from the normal selling prices at which those
        particular Goods may be available on the website or mobi-site. <br />{" "}
        <br />
        2. You will only receive the App Only Deal price if you pay for your
        order using the App before the App Only Deal has expired or sells out.
        You will not receive the App Only Deal price if you pay for your order
        using the website or mobi-site, or if you don’t pay for your order
        before the App Only Deal has expired or sells out.
